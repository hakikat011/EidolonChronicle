# Shor's Algorithm and RSA Encryption
The Enigma Unveiled
Shor's Algorithm, named after mathematician Peter Shor, is a quantum algorithm that revolutionized the field of cryptography. It is designed to efficiently factor large numbers, a task that classical computers struggle with.

# Breaking the RSA Cipher
RSA encryption, based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers, forms the backbone of modern secure communication. However, Shor's Algorithm poses a significant threat to RSA encryption. By leveraging the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement, Shor's Algorithm can factorize the product of two large prime numbers exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms. This breakthrough has far-reaching implications for the security landscape.
